                    <p class="project-description">AKT Practice is a web-based learning platform designed to help GP trainees prepare for the Applied Knowledge Test (AKT). It combines a structured question bank with topic-linked revision guides, allowing users to test knowledge and immediately reinforce learning. The system uses a flexible backend architecture so each question can surface one or more relevant revision guides, enabling scalable content growth without duplication. The platform prioritises clarity, performance, and clinically relevant learning over rote memorisation.</p>

                                    <p class="project-description">I worked as the technical implementer and systems integrator. I designed and implemented the database architecture, built the question and revision-guide linking logic, handled Supabase schema design and relationships, and integrated the frontend with the backend. I focused on making the system scalable and flexible so questions can link to multiple revision guides without data duplication, while keeping performance stable.</p>

                    <h2 class="project-title">Barely Soldered Website & Necrowarp Subsite</h2>
                    <p class="project-description">Barely Soldered is an indie game studio website built to showcase the developer and its projects, with dedicated subsites for individual games such as Necrowarp. The site features a dark-fantasy inspired aesthetic, responsive layouts, media galleries, and integrated support/contact systems, all designed to be performant, accessible, and easy to maintain without a traditional backend.</p>
                    <p class="project-description">The platform was structured to scale as new games are added, with each title receiving its own pages for information, media, and player support. Deployment and hosting are handled via a Git-based workflow with Netlify, enabling fast updates and simple content iteration.</p>
                    <h3 style="margin:0.5em 0 0.2em 0; font-size:1em; color:#333;">My Role</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">This was my first real client project, where I was responsible for implementing and deploying the support and contact system across the main site and the Necrowarp subsite. I built multiple Netlify Forms with custom subject routing, ticket ID generation, spam protection, and confirmation pages, while ensuring the system worked correctly across desktop and mobile devices.</p>
                    <p class="project-description">I also handled real-world debugging and deployment issues, including asset path resolution, mobile browser behavior, and DNS/SSL configuration, and iterated on the UI based on direct client feedback. This project gave me hands-on experience shipping a live production feature while working closely with a client and adapting to evolving requirements.</p>
